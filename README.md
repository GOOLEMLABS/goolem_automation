Goolem – Vision-Guided Linux Desktop Agent

Goolem is an experimental AI agent that understands natural language and controls a Linux desktop using visual perception and code generation.

It is split into two main components:

    goolem-agent: A language model-driven agent that interprets instructions, generates code, and coordinates execution.

    goolem-bot: A system-level executor that provides screen capture, mouse, and keyboard control on a Linux desktop.

🚀 What Can It Do?

    💬 Understand natural language instructions like:

        “Find the IceWM start button and click it.”

    👁️ Capture the screen and use GPT-4 Vision to locate objects

    🖱️ Move the mouse or click on identified areas

    ⌨️ Simulate keyboard typing or key presses

    🧠 Dynamically generate and execute Python code using a controlled sandbox

✨ Example Workflow

    You type:

Find the terminal icon on the desktop and click it.

The agent replies with:

    gs.grab_screen("")
    resultado = fcfd("terminal icon")
    gm.move(resultado)
    gm.click()

    The code is executed by the agent using goolem-bot.

🧰 Tech Stack

    Python 3.9+

    OpenAI GPT-4o for vision and reasoning

    litellm for API abstraction

    X11-based Linux desktop automation (via PyUserInput / pyxhook or similar)

    Modular system architecture

🔐 Safety

    All code generated by the agent is executed inside a sandboxed environment.

    Only safe, pre-defined methods are available (gs, gm, gk, and vision helpers).

    __builtins__ are disabled during code execution.

🧪 Development and Debugging

To run the agent:

cd goolem-agent
python3 main_agent.py

To test the screen/mouse/keyboard modules:

from goolem_bot.screen import gScreen
gs = gScreen()
gs.grab_screen("")

📦 Installation

    Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file with your OpenAI API key:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
